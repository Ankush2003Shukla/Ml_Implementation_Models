# Ml_Implementation_Models

This repository contains two machine learning models developed using Python and various libraries. The models are designed to perform Customer Segmentation using KMeans Clustering and Movie Recommendation System.

# Models Overview

1. Customer Segmentation using KMeans Clustering - 
Customer segmentation is a technique used by businesses to divide customers into groups based on common characteristics. In this model, KMeans clustering algorithm is employed to segment customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior.

2. Movie Recommendation System - 
A movie recommendation system helps users discover new movies based on the movie name suggest. This model employs collaborative filtering technique to recommend movies to users based on their cosine similarity score.

# Getting Started

Prerequisites
1.Python 3.x
2.Required libraries: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn (for KMeans clustering), cosine-similarity (for movie recommendation system)
